## :cloud: Installation

You can install the package globally and use it as command line tool:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g @katistix/license-cli
```

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn global add @katistix/license-cli
```

## :clipboard: Usage

To use this tool, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
license <license_type>
```

Replace `<license_type>` with the license you want to use. A list of supported licenses can be found in the `/licenses` folder.

Example to add the MIT license to your project:

```bash
license mit
```

This will create a `LICENSE` file in the current directory with the MIT license.

Now all you have to do is to modify the year and your name inside the license file.
